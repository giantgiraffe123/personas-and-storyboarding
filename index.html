    <h1>Personas and Storyboarding</h1>
    <h2>For Users of Andrews' Coca Cola Machines</h2>

    <div class="intro">
      <p style="padding-right: 8%; padding-top: 3%">
        For this project, I observed users using an interface and conducted
        interviews in order to build a persona to represent the standard users
        of this interface and a storyboard for one of these personas. For my
        interface, I chose the Coca Cola Machines at Andrew's dining hall in
        Brown University, and I observed how users interacted with and used the
        interface. Here is a picture of the main screen of the machine:

      <h4>Observations</h4>
      <ul style="margin-top: 0.5%">
        <li>
          Users generally first get a cup from the cup stack next to the machine
          and then wait in line
        </li>
        <li>
          When it is their turn to use the machine, first they place their cup
          down
        </li>
        <li>
          Users then press buttons on the screen, first to select the category
          of drink and then to select the specific drink
        </li>
        <li>
          Some users know exactly what they want, others hesitate for a moment
          while they browse the options
        </li>
        <li>
          None of the people I observed used the filters at the bottom to filter
          for low-calorie or caffeine-free drinks
        </li>
        <li>
          Many people had to press the buttons multiple times in order to select
          their option - they appeared frustrated and impatient.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then once the drink was selected, they pressed the pour button to fill
          their cup.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h4>Interview Questions</h4>
      <ol style="margin-top: 0.5%">

        <li>How do you know what you want?</li>
        <li>
          Do you come with an idea of what you want or do you decide when you
          get here?
        </li>
        <li>How do you find the drink you want on the screen?</li>
        <li>How do you get that drink into your cup?</li>

      <h4>User Responses</h4>
      <ul style="margin-top: 0.5%">
        <li>
          Users noted that usually they go to the machine to get the same drink
          every time
        </li>
        <li>
          Users described the layout of the drink options to be hierarchical,
          with at first all the options displayed on the main screen, and the
          different flavors of those options available once you press on the
          drink.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users expressed frustration with the number of times they have to
          click the screen before their touch is registered, especially when
          they are in a rush or there is a line of people waiting.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users noted that the flavors could be larger/more readable, especially
          for the sub flavors.
        </li>
        <li>
          The layout of the machine is intuitive to new users - with buttons
          that are circular and look like they should be pressed to choose a
          flavor, and are gray if they cannot be pressed since the drink is
          gone. Even though there is no sign on where to place your cup, the
          large surface under the drink selection allows users to assume the
          drink will pour from above when they press the pour button, and that’s
          where the cup goes.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Personas!!!</h3>
    <div class="personas">
      <div>
        <img src="Images/student_persona.JPG" width="450 px" height="auto" />
        <p class="caption">
          This is a persona to represent students who are familiar with the
          machine. The persona faces the problem of the interface not responding
          immediately to touch and the pressure of the line behind them. This
          persona represents these users because it generally has an idea of
          what they want when they go to the machine, experiences disappointment
          when their favorites have run out, and experiences difficulty pressing
          the buttons on the interface’s screen.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <img src="Images/new_users_persona.JPG" width="450 px" height="auto" />
        <p class="caption">
          This persona reflects new users of the machine - such as first-year
          students. This persona faces the problem of figuring out how the
          machine works for the first time and getting acquainted with the
          interface. They too face the problem of a laggy interactive screen on
          the interface. The persona represents the users because it captures
          their shared uncertainty at first about the interface and quick
          ability to pick up on how to use it intuitively.
